# PESQ: Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality
# https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.862
# 
# PESQ is a reference-based metric that measures speech quality
# by comparing a degraded signal to a reference signal.
# 
# Supported sample rates:
# - 8kHz: narrowband (nb) mode
# - 16kHz: wideband (wb) mode
# - Other rates: automatically resampled to nearest supported rate
